## 🎯 Potential UI/UX Opportunities (From Previous Analysis)

The previous AI-04 check identified these opportunities, which remain valid:

### Priority 1: Admin Console UI Review & Enhancement
**Rationale:** Admin console was built by backend developer (AI-07). UI/UX specialist review could ensure:
- Consistency with dLNk design system
- Optimal user experience
- Professional visual polish
- Accessibility compliance

**Scope:**
- Review 7 view files (login, dashboard, licenses, users, logs, tokens, settings)
- Review 5 component files (sidebar, header, table, chart, dialog)
- Audit against STYLE_GUIDE.md
- Create enhancement recommendations

**Estimated Effort:** Medium (2-3 hours)

---

### Priority 2: Integration UI Components
**Rationale:** Backend systems are ready for integration. Clear UI components needed for:
- License activation flow
- Token status indicators
- Connection status displays
- Error state handling
- Loading states

**Scope:**
- Design license activation mockups
- Create status indicator specifications
- Design error and loading state components
- Document component usage guidelines

**Estimated Effort:** Medium (2-3 hours)

---

### Priority 3: Icon Set Expansion
**Rationale:** Only one icon (activity bar) currently exists. Comprehensive icon set needed for:
- License status (active, expired, trial)
- Connection status (online, offline, connecting)
- Security alerts (low, medium, high)
- User types (trial, pro, enterprise)
- Admin actions (create, edit, delete, ban)

**Scope:**
- Audit current icon needs
- Design missing icons
- Export in multiple formats
- Update icon documentation

**Estimated Effort:** Low (1-2 hours)

---

### Priority 4: Data Visualization Enhancement
**Rationale:** Admin console includes charts. Enhanced visualizations would improve:
- License usage statistics
- User activity monitoring
- API usage tracking
- System health dashboards

**Scope:**
- Review current chart implementations
- Design improved visualizations
- Specify color schemes
- Provide implementation guidelines

**Estimated Effort:** Medium (2-3 hours)
